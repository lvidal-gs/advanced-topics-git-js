# About
This is a little project that i've done to learn about some contents in JS, like tests, more advanced topics about the language and some of your characteristics.
And more... I'm training git concepts like workflow, standards of commits, configs and other things.

My ambition with this project is: **none**. That'is just for learning and improvement to myself.

For the person who's reading this, just take a look. My annotations are kinda weird.
